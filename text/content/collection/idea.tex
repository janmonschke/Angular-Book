\section{Idea}

\textbf{collection.do} is a web service that allows to collect arbitrary multimedia content form various web sources and to organize the collected bits of content into collections. Users can add content using its URL and the backend then fetches rich previews of the content. Collection.do in its current form can be seen as a combination of delicous\footnote{\url{https://delicious.com}, last-checked on 22/04/2014}, a social bookmarking service, and Pinterest\footnote{\url{https://pinterest.com}, last-checked on 22/04/2014}, a visual content aggregation tool. It is however in this version not intended for sharing content with others or to discover web resources. It is much more a tool to create private collections e.g. for brain storming or to organize events. Future versions of the collection.do will have a sharing and an aggregation feature to allow users to collaboratively work on collections.
